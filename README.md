# Azure CosmoDB GET/POST REST Request builder function using Powershell

Uses PowerShell to format DB requests to Azure CosmoDB  
the very very beginning of an azure cosmodb sdk for PowerShell. lmao

ugly on request... i promise

if you are thinking of using this, please consider this;  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/sql/sql-api-sdk-dotnet


todo//  
build out every needed REST function  
seperate the existing into own functions because it hurts to see it this way
